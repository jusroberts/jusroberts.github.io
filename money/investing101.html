        <p>
            Let's take a look at some graphs of inflation over time.
            First we have a long range chart, 1958 - 2017:
        <img src="images/inflation-1958-2017.svg">
            There's a lot of crazy stuff happening up through the 80s, but more recently it's calmed down immensely.

        <p>
            Next, let's look at a more recent view, 2000 - 2017:
        <img src="images/inflation-2010-2017.svg">
            The Fed has made it a goal to keep inflation around 2%*, and we can see that we're right about there on any given year.
            If your investment returns are greater then that, then your money is growing in value. If it's less, then you're losing value.

    </div>
    And that's great, but please stop interrupting me. We'll get there. This is a journey.

<p>
    <h2 id="the-market">The Market</h2>
    <p>
        When people talk about "The Market" doing [well|poorly], they're generally talking about the S&P 500 or some other similar <i>index</i> of companies.
        In the example of the S&P 500, it "tracks" 500 large companies like Google, AT&T, and 3M. You can find the full listing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies">here</a>.
        With any index, the value of each component company is weighted and combined, giving a value for that index, in this case, listed as <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx">SPX</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, if someone says that the Economy is doing poorly today as evidenced by the S&P 500 being down, say 5 percent, that means that of the companies that make up the S&P 500, more of them are doing worse than good - enough so to move the value of all of them down.
        Any given index being "down" or "up" doesn't reflect what the entire economy is doing, just the general movement of those companies involved.
        The actual formulation that describes how each company contributes to the movements of a given index is beyond the scope of this course, but if you're interested in that, the info is publicly available.
    </p>
    <p> 
        So, let's take a look at historical returns of the S&P 500
    </p>
    <h3>Log Scale</h3>
    <img src="images/SnP500-log.png">
    <div class="footnote">Generated at <a href="http://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data">http://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data</a>.</div>

    <p>
        Something you don't usually see when looking at stock charts is the logarithmic scaled chart.
        An advantage this gives you is that you are able to see percentage increases linearly (i.e. a 6% increase from 100 looks the same as a 6% increase from 100000).
    </p>
    <h3>Linear Scale</h3>

    <p>Much harder to interpret.</p>
    <p>Next, let's look at how things turn out over time.</p>

        The above table shows the best and worst 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 year periods of the S&P 500, going all the way back to 1929.
        To create these numbers, I used data from <a href="http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html">http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html</a> and the magic of spreadsheets to generate these geometric averages.

    <p>
        In any given year, an index like this can have massive swings. 
        However, if you're able to ride out the storm, investing in an index like this has historically been pretty good, yielding an 8% annual return over the worst 25-year period.

        Simple enough. You try to match those indices. With Funds.

<h1 id="funds">Funds</h1>
<p>
    Funds take some subset of investments (US Large Capitalization Stocks, European Junk Bonds, etc) and bundle them in a way that's easy for casual investors to trade.
    A bunch of people will pool their money via a broker, and that broker will buy and sell on their behalf.
    <h3 id="mutual-and-index-funds">Mutual and Index Funds</h3>
    <p>
        The two main types are Mutual Funds and Index funds, where Index funds are a subset of Mutual funds.
        Just like stocks, these funds will have shares that you can buy. 
        Each of those shares will represent the basket of investments the fund contains.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike normal stocks and bonds though, funds have a <i>fee</i> associated with holding them. 
        This fee is called the <b>Expense Ratio</b> and is used to pay for any overhead associated with running the fund.
        The lower the overhead, the lower the fee. 
    </p>
    <br clear="left">
    <img src="images/vanguard-vs-snp.png" align="right">
    <p>
        One of the easiest ways to lower fees is to not <i>actively</i> pick the underlying assets, and instead tie the fund to an <i>index</i> like we talked about above.
        Mutual Funds that do this are called <i>Index Funds</i>.
        On the image to the right, you can see an index fund that is attempting to track the S&P 500, and how closely it's able to do so.
        In this case, we're looking at the <a href="https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT&funds_disable_redirect=true">Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="expense-ratios">Expense Ratios</h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, every fund will have an Expense Ratio.
        This is the <i>Percentage Cost Per Year</i> to participate in a given fund.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, for example, if you buy into a fund that has an expense ratio of 1%, and the fund yields 3% this year, you'll have a profit of 2%.
        What does that mean in real money? Have a look below:
    </p>
    <img src="images/slight-differences-in-returns.png">
    <div class="footnote"><a href="http://www.diyinvesting.com">www.diyinvesting.com</a></div>
    <p>
        I've highlighted the 8% and 7% lines to show what you might find if you were in a fund that returned 8%, but had an expense ratio of 1%.
        In the above example, we're only dealing with $1000, but over a course of 40 years. 
        If you follow the dotted lines back to the left axis, you'll see that there's a difference of roughly $6,000 in the returns lost to the expense ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
        But enough theory, let's take a look at some real-life funds and their expense ratios.
    </p>
    <h3>So what do actual funds looks like?</h3>
    <div class="half">
        <img src="images/FXSIX-tab.png">
        <div class="center">Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXSIX)</div>
        A fidelity Index fund with an expense ratio of <b>0.035%</b>
    </div>
    <div class="half">
        <img src="images/FSCRX-tab.png">
        <div class="center">Fidelity Small Cap Discovery Fund (FSCRX)</div>
        A fidelity Mutual fund with an expense ratio of <b>1.01%</b>
    </div>
    <p>
        The above funds are real life examples that I pulled from my company's 401k plan.
        In order for the fund on the right (FSCRX) to compete with the left (FXSIX), it must overcome .975% of returns.
    </p>
    <img src="images/vanguard-fund-tabs.png">
    <p>
        Further, some funds will give you better expense ratios when you deposit more money.
        In the above example I've listed two Vanguard funds that only differ in their minimum depost.
        On the left, a deposit between $3000 and $9999 will get you an expense ratio of 0.15%.
        On the right, a deposit over $10,000 will get you an expense ratio of 0.04%.
    </p>
    <h2 id="buying-a-fund">Buying a fund</h2>
    <p>
        There are two main ways to buy a fund: through a broker's own service, or on a stock exchange using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).
    </p>
    <h3>Through a broker's service</h3>
    <p>
        For this example, I'll use Vanguard, as I have experience with their process:
        <ul>
                <li>Create an account
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal or Retirement (IRA/etc)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Select one or more funds to throw your money at
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many funds have several tiers, like “Investor” and “Admiral”</li>
                        <li>“Admiral” funds require a higher minimum balance, but have lower Expense Ratios</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Set up a bank transfer for your initial deposit
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each fund has a minimum balance, so at least that</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You can then set up recurring automatic deposits (or not)</li>
        </ul>
        An advantage of going through the broker is that you may be able to purchase partial shares.
        This means that if a share costs $100, and you deposit $150, you'll get 1.5 shares, ensuring that your extra $50 is collecting more than dust.
    </p>
    <h3>ETFs</h3>
    <p>
        ETFs are funds bought and sold on a normal stock exchange.
        For most of the funds that a broker provides, you'll be able to find the equivalend ETF on the open market. 
    </p>
    <p>
        With ETFs, you get more flexibility in buying and selling, but you don't get the total allocation that buying partial shares gets you.
        If you'd like more info ETFs, I'd suggest google.
