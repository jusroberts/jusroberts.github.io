The resultant frequency set is then compared to sample ping pong ball strikes that we gathered previously. If the frequencies are within an acceptable margin of each other, then we consider a hit to have taken place.\r\n\r\n![picture](www.google.com)\r\n\r\nSuspected \"hits\" were recorded in a database, from which a [rails application](https://github.com/jusroberts/rails-sound-spy) hosted on the Raspberry Pi displayed the table's in-use status, which was determined by whether or not a sufficient amount of hits occurred in the last minute or so. Everyone on the company network could view and use this information as needed.\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nThis project ended up being a huge success around the company. Coworkers used and suggested improvements for it. After implementing the FFT algorithm, the project never seemed to be inaccurate. \r\n","google":"UA-64908153-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
